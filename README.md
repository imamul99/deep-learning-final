# Deep Learning for Pediatric Wrist Fracture Detection Using YOLOv8 Algorithm

# Abstract:  
<p>
Wrist fractures are common, particularly among children who experience a high incidence of 
such injuries. Before surgery, X-ray imaging is typically required, with treatment plans 
informed by radiologist analysis. The rapid advancement of neural networks has led to the 
widespread use of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series in fracture detection as part of 
computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems. In 2023, Ultralytics released the newest YOLO 
model variant, designed for detecting fractures in various body parts. A key innovation in 
enhancing model performance is the use of attention mechanisms. This study introduces the 
YOLOv8-AM, which integrates attention mechanisms into the YOLOv8 framework. Four 
specific attention modules—Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Global 
Attention Mechanism (GAM), Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), and Shuffle Attention 
(SA)—are incorporated to develop improved versions of the model. These versions were 
trained on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. Results show that the YOLOv8-AM model with 
ResCBAM achieved a state-of-the-art mean Average Precision at IoU 50 (mAP 50) of 65.8%, 
up from 63.6%. Meanwhile, the model with GAM achieved only a marginal increase of 64.2%, 
leading to the development of ResGAM, which improved mAP 50 to 65.0%.
